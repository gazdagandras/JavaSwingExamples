# Counter

Pressing Count button, the number within the textfield is incremented. The textfield should not be editable.

On Start button, the number increases by one on every second automatically. The Stop button cancels the automated incrementation.

Use javax.swing.Timer to automate the incrementation. More information: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Timer.html
